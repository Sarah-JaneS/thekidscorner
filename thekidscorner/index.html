			<p>They’re insanely cute, fluffy and friendly . . . it’s no wonder valais blacknose sheep are hot right now. The new-to-New Zealand, Swiss sheep breed has only been in the country five years, but its popularity is soaring. If you have a bit of land and want to join the trend, be prepared to get your chequebook out – they’re selling for between $2000 and $20,000 a head.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>From a standing start in 2017 when the government relaxed importing laws, there are now over 100 breeding flocks offering them, mainly as pets for lifestyle blocks. North Canterbury farmer Melissa Cowan was among the first to breed the sheep in 2018, on her 340 hectare farm (mixed arable, dairy grazing and fattening lambs) in Greta Valley. Although having the sheep started as a “side project”, she is now the chairperson of the New Zealand Valais Blacknose Sheep society and says more and more of her time is taken up with them. She and husband Hayden keep about five purebred stud rams, 30 purebred ewes and about 100 first or second generation cross-breeds (crossed with romneys). She says their appeal is 100% down to the cute factor. “People just fall in love with them. And they’re so friendly. They’re perfect for a lifestyle block.” While in Switzerland they can be used for meat and wool, that’s not generally the case in New Zealand. Although Cowan has been told they’re a “very nice eating sheep”.</p>

			<p>Valais blacknose are not hard to care for but do grow a lot of wool, and so need shearing twice a year, she says.Their wool is “quite a high micron count”, which makes it not suitable for clothing, but it makes good crafting wool for felting, or making cushions, carpets and rugs. Cromwell breeder Leigh-Anne Peake, from Rose Creek Valais Blacknose NZ, was also one of the first to import embryos from the UK, with lambs born in 2018.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Peake says their popularity is due to their “charming personality and nature, shaggy coats, long spiral horns, and black faces and ears”. She says $2000 would buy a wether (castrated ram), with some purebred rams going for up to $20,000. Cowan says purebred ewes sell for $8000 to $10,000, but some people are crossing them with other breeds – using a purebred ram and a “foundation” ewe – to make them more affordable.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>While the price tag may seem expensive, Peake compares it to buying a dog.“You might spend $4500 buying a pug. We call them ‘paddock puppies’ because they’re friendly, cute and fluffy.” She says the sheep love humans. “They walk straight up, always wanting pats and cuddles.” City folk should not get too excited. Cowan says they do need a good bit of land to move around, and won’t do well in a section in town. “Obviously with your backyard at home, you’re not necessarily going to have enough grass for them all year.”</p>
